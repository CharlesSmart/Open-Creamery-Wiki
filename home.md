# Cheese
## Overview
Vegan cheese generally fits into 3 categories: cultured cheese, instant cheese and cheese-like substitutes.
Cultured cheeses like those popularised my Miyoko Schinner in her book Artisan Vegan Cheese generally follow a process more similar to traditional cheese making, culturing a base ingredient (generally cashews) to create a tangy, cheese-like flavour. Culturing also produces some amount of “cheesy-ness” but cultured recipes often still call for the addition of additional flavouring elements to add other cheese flavours e.g. nutritional yeast, miso, tahini.

Instant cheeses skip any culturing step, meaning that the acidity and tanginess of cheese must be replicated in another way. This is often done by adding lactic acid, a method popularised by Skye Michael Conroy. It can also be achieved with lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and using other similar acids. Again cheese-like flavours can be added through the addition of additional flavourings.

Cheese-like substitutes are cheeses that seek to replicate the function of cheese in a single dish. For example a nacho cheese sauce. These cheeses are usually the easiest for beginners, requiring no culturing time and minimal specialty ingredients like kappa carrageenan (a gelling agent).
